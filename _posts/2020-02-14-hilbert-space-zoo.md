This is a place to put examples of everyone's favorite [complete inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space).
Real spaces are only listed if both real and complex are common.

- All real and complex finite dimensional vector spaces
- $L^2(\Omega)$ like $L^2(\R)$ and $L^2[0, 1]$
- Weighted $L^2$ by integrating with another $L^2$ function.
- $l^2$ isomorphic to all infinite-dimensional separable hilbert spaces
- $H^s$(\Omega)$ is $L^2$ functions with $s$ weak-derivatives in $L^2$
- Hardy space are holomorphic functions on unit disk whose power series converges at $r = 1$.
- Bergman space are holomorphic functions that are in $L^2$.
- Harmonic functions on the unit ball.
- Reproducing kernel hilbert spaces generated by positive-definite kernels
- Reproducing kernel hilbert spaces generateed by feature maps
- Fock space
