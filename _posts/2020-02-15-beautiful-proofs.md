There are a lot of proofs whose clever simplicitly is [worth writing down](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/28788/nontrivial-theorems-with-trivial-proofs/28791).

"... the snobbery of the young, who think that a theorem is trivial because its proof is trivial." -- 'the quote is a garbled version of Grothendieck, quoting Ronnie Brown quoting J.H.C. Whitehead. I found it on p.188 of the PDF version of Récoltes et Semailles'
